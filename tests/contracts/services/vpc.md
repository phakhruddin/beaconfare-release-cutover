# VPC

Create one VPC with two public and two private subnets, one of each in two
different availability zones of `region`.

- Public subnets route `0.0.0.0/0` to an internet gateway. The load balancer
  lives in them.
- Private subnets have no route to the internet gateway. Every ECS task runs
  in them, with public IP assignment disabled.
- The load balancer's security group admits TCP on both listener ports. The
  tasks' security group admits TCP `8080` from the load balancer's security
  group only.

Security groups and route tables are recorded by this endpoint but do not
filter packets. They are checked as declarations only.

## Manifest fields

Record in `manifest.network`: `vpc_id`, `public_subnet_ids` and
`private_subnet_ids`.
